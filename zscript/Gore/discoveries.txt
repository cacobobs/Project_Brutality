some discoveries i have made along the course of the blood overhaul's development:
- don't overuse FindFloorCeiling, it is very expensive
    cut down blood script time by about 10x by just calling this function ONCE instead of every tic
- DistanceCheck can be more detrimental to performance than helpful, especially with a slow CPU and fast GPU, which is usually the case
